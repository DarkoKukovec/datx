The `@datx/jsonapi-angular` library exposes the `jsonapiAngular` mixin. Its functionality is similar to the `jsonapi` mixin from the `@datx/jsonapi` library, but instead of Promises, it exposes RxJS Observables as return values for all asynchronous functions.

For more details, please check out [Angular setup example](../examples/angular-setup.md).
