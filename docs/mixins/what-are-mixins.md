Mixins are packages that enhance the `datx` model or collection functionality. Two mixins are builtin into the core library ([`withMeta`](with-meta) and [`withActions`](with-actions)).

Other mixins that can be installed separately:
* [`JSON API`](mixin-jsonapi)

There are some other mixins that are [planned](https://github.com/infinum/datx/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Amixins).

Have an idea for a mixin? [Open an issue](https://github.com/infinum/datx/issues/new) or [create your own](building-your-own-mixin).
